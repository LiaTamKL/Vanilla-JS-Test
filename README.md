# Vanilla JS Test

An assignment using Vanilla Javascript only for an ecommerce test. To finish this assignment, the site needs to render server JSON as Divs, with subdivs for subdata. Each div and subdiv will have a similar structure but you cannot know ahead of time how many subdivs a div might have. Additionally, each subdiv must be one of 4 background colors, so there is a need to create an array for colors for the divs to always have different colors from the previous div, and from the next one.

Due to CORS constraints, this will only work with a local server such as Vscode's Live Server.
